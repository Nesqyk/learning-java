## 1. Understanding Computer Files

### Presenter: Jelian Batobalonos

A computer file is a resource for storing information, which is available to a computer program and is usually based on some kind of durable storage. A file is durable in the sense that it remains available for programs to use after the current program has finished.

### Key Concepts

#### File Types
- **Text Files** (human-readable, e.g., .txt, .java)
- **Binary Files** (not human-readable, e.g., .jpg, .exe)

#### File Systems
A file system is a method and data structure that an operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved. It organizes files into a hierarchical structure of directories (or folders).

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
C:\ (Root)
├── Users/
│   └── John/
│       ├── Documents/
│       │   ├── report.txt
│       │   └── images/
│       │       └── photo.jpg
│       └── Downloads/
└── Program Files/
    └── Java/
```

## 2. Using Path and File Classes

### Presenter: Joseph

Java provides the `Path` and `File` classes to work with files and directories. The `Path` class is part of the newer NIO (New I/O) API and is generally preferred over the older `File` class.

### The Path Class
The `Path` interface represents the path to a file or directory.

### The File Class
The `File` class is the older way of representing files and directories.

## 3. File Organization

### Presenter: Laurence Cabizares Lo

File organization refers to the way data is stored in a file. The choice of file organization depends on the application.

### Common Methods

1. **Sequential Organization**: Records are stored in a specific order, such as by a key field. This is simple to implement but can be slow for random access.

2. **Random (or Direct) Access Organization**: Records are stored at a specific location (address) that can be calculated from a key field. This allows for fast random access.

3. **Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM)**: A hybrid of sequential and random access. Records are stored sequentially, but an index is used to speed up access.

## 4. Streams and Buffers

### Presenter: Shainey Selgas

In Java, I/O operations are based on the concept of streams.

### Streams
A stream is a sequence of data. It can be an Input Stream (for reading) or an Output Stream (for writing). They are categorized into Byte Streams (binary data) and Character Streams (Unicode data).

### Buffers
A buffer is a temporary storage location in memory. Buffering is used to improve the performance of I/O operations by reading/writing data in larger chunks. `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` are common classes for this.

[View Code Example](StreamsAndBuffers.java)

## 5. Using Java's I/O Classes

### Presenter: Tyrone Tabornal

Java's `java.io` package provides a rich set of classes for I/O operations.

### Reading from a File
Using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`:

### Writing to a File
Using `FileWriter` and `BufferedWriter`:

## 6. Creating and Using Sequential Data Files

### Presenter: Joan Borres

A sequential data file is a file where records are stored and accessed one after another in a sequence.

### Creating a Sequential File
To create a sequential file, you can write records to it one by one. Example: Writing Student Records

### Reading from a Sequential File
To read from a sequential file, you read the records in the same order they were written. Example: Reading Student Records

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with Section 1** - Understanding Computer Files
2. **Learn Path/File classes** - Section 2
3. **Understand organization methods** - Section 3
4. **Master streams and buffers** - Section 4
5. **Practice with I/O classes** - Section 5
6. **Apply sequential file concepts** - Section 6

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Files are durable** - They persist after program execution
- **Path is preferred** over File class for new Java code
- **Choose organization method** based on access patterns
- **Use buffered streams** for better performance
- **Always handle exceptions** in I/O operations
- **Sequential access** reads/writes records in order
